# QOSF-Mentorship-Program
This repositorium contains the report of my project "How NEAT Can Help in Quantum Error Decoding" done in course of the mentorship program offered by Quantum Open Source Foundation.
The goal was to implement the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08093 and learn about toric code and neuro-evolution along the way.
This repo also includes my solution to the screening task for the program.
