# Quantum-Error-Decoding-using-NEAT
This repositorium contains the report of my project done in course of the mentorship program offered by Quantum Open Source Foundation.
The goal was to implement the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08093 and learn about toric code and neuro-evolution along the way.
This repo includes also my solution to the screening task for the program.
